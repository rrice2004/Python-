# Python Software Security Review Generator
This tool is designed to streamline the process of performing a software security review from the command line. You can use it to start a new review, capturing key information about the software, its data handling practices, security measures, and integration risks. Existing reviews can be continued or updated, and the tool can generate both PDF reports for official documentation and Word tables for print-ready manual notes. It’s especially useful for security teams or compliance officers who need a structured, repeatable way to assess software risk without relying on a graphical interface.
